## Hiya Piper and/or team!
First off, thanks for taking the time to review this, I truly appreciate the opportunity.
I built to cover the general topics that we spoke about during the first interview, so there's a little bit of everything in there while still being pretty straightforward to reason about.
I was originally going to build something _significantly_ more complex but while planning I got word that you'd prefer "...a simple page so he can show both Javascript and CSS. Looking mostly at the coding practices and not necessarily overly complex functionality."
Which makes sense, who wants to do a full code review on a big ol' app when you're looking for practices more than anything.
So here we are! 
### you know the deal, hit that `yarn start` and tell me what you think :)
